TemplateXBlock
==============

Ignore this. startnew.py in the xblock-sdk repo is probably what you're looking for. 

This is a wizard which will create a new XBlock for you. 

To use, first set up xblock-sdk: 

    https://github.com/edx/xblock-sdk

Then run: 

    git clone https://github.com/pmitros/TemplateXBlock
    cd TemplateXBlock
    ./xmaker.py

And follow the instructions! You should be good to go in a few
minutes. 

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.
